# # Plywood Cutting Calculation (Basic Greedy Approach)

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook demonstrates a simple approach to calculating how to cut smaller rectangular pieces from a larger sheet of plywood. It uses a greedy approach, prioritizing larger pieces first.

# %% [markdown]
# **Disclaimer:** This is a simplified approach and may not yield the absolute most optimal layout (minimum waste). For complex scenarios, consider specialized cutting optimization software or libraries.

# ## 1. Define Plywood and Piece Dimensions

# %%
# Define the dimensions of the plywood sheet (in a consistent unit, e.g., inches)
plywood_width = 48
plywood_height = 96

# Define the list of pieces you need to cut (each as a tuple: (width, height))
pieces_to_cut = [
    (12, 24),
    (18, 36),
    (12, 18),
    (15, 15),
    (12, 24),  # Another piece of the same size
]

# Sort the pieces in descending order of area to prioritize larger pieces (greedy approach)
pieces_to_cut.sort(key=lambda item: item[0] * item[1], reverse=True)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Implement a Simple Cutting Function

# %% [markdown]
# ## Explanation:
#
# 1.  **Define Dimensions:** The size of the plywood sheet and the list of pieces to cut from it are defined.
# 2.  **Greedy Approach:** The `pieces_to_cut` are sorted by area (largest first). This is a simple greedy strategy that often works well for starting; it attempts to fit the biggest pieces first, potentially leaving larger scraps that might fit smaller pieces later.
# 3.  **`cut_plywood` Function:**
#     -   The function takes the plywood dimensions and the list of pieces as input.
#     -   It maintains a list of `free_spaces`, initially containing the entire plywood sheet.
#     -   The function iterates through the pieces and attempts to find a `free_space` where the piece can be placed.
#     -   If a space is found, the piece's location is recorded in `cut_layout`.
#     -   The used `free_space` is (simplistically) replaced by the remaining areas created by the cut.  This part is basic; a more advanced algorithm would use a more sophisticated method for dividing and managing free spaces to account for different cutting orientations and more complex nested layouts.
# 4.  **Simulation and Results:** The function is called, and the `layout` and `remaining` pieces are printed.

# ## Limitations:
#
# This is a basic implementation. For real-world applications, you might need to consider:
#
# -   **Cutting Kerf:** The width of the saw blade, which removes material and needs to be accounted for in calculations.
# -   **Rotation:** Whether pieces can be rotated 90 degrees to fit better.
# -   **More Sophisticated Placement Algorithms:** Techniques like integer programming or genetic algorithms can find more optimal layouts by exploring different cutting patterns and minimizing waste.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Further Enhancements:
#
# -   **Visualize the layout:** Use libraries like Matplotlib to graphically represent the plywood sheet and the cut pieces.
# -   **Implement a more advanced free space management algorithm:** Explore techniques like "maximal rectangles" to accurately track remaining usable areas.
# -   **Explore optimization libraries:** Libraries like `Pyomo` or other constraint programming tools could be used to find the best layout by formulating it as an optimization problem.
